Instructions:

Unzip the file. 
To run the file go into the dist folder and double click app.

UI should pop up with a terminal, the terminal will help show you what is happening

Immediately adjust SAVED_FILE_LOCATION to your folder path. This will need to be updated on every opening of the tool.

UI Inputs and Buttons

	UI Inputs

		SAVED_FILE_LOCATION: This is where you unzip the file. Within this folder should be the build, list folder and 

		Sport URL: Leave as Tennis haven't tested with other sports

		Tournament URLS: If you want to search specifically for one tournament

	UI Buttons

		BookMakers Numbering. Produces a csv of the current bookmaker numbering. This gets loaded to understand odds portals key data

		Get Full List of Tourney URLS: Produces a CSV of all the URLS in the sport. This will help for the Tournament URL UI to be input

		Run Tournament URL All Years: This will run the Tournament entered in the URL box for all years available

		Run Full Output (CAN TAKE WEEKS): This will run every tournament from the list

	UI OUTPUTS
		
		The Outputs from the UI will be stored in from UI 
		SAVED_FILE_LOCATION/results
		Additionally it will not rerun any csv file that is saved in that directory. 
		So if you want to rerun certain tournaments or certain years remove it from the results folder


Please reach out via Upwork if you need assistance. As part of hiring I will perform bug fixes and help as you utilize the tool so please reach out.
